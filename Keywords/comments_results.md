## Comment concerning our results

We are aware that our results (cf. Average-result.png) 
are really not good. We are not happy with them. 

We really spent a lot of time trying several different ways of preprocessing 
the images, but this has not yet resulted in any improvements. 
We especially had problems with binarization and resizing, 
obviously this has lead to a lot of problems in feature extraction. 
We also tried including and excluding a lot of features, 
but never managed to find the right combination of things 
to get decent results.
